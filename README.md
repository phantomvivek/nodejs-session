# Node.js Walkthrough

In this code walkthrough, we will go through a simple Node.js / Express app.
We will cover some basics of Node.js as well as Express:

- Setting up a basic node.js app
- Using Express as a framework to make a lot of things easier
- Using middlewares for various functions like logging, authentication, error handling, etc.

# Steps to follow:

1. npm install
2. Once node module installation has completed, we will go through the files starting from server.js and complete all the TODOs, i.e. complete code to get the app up and running!

If you get stuck anywhere, check the completed folder for the code.

# Order of Files to Go Through:

1. server.js
2. middlewares/errorHandler.js
3. middlewares/logger.js
4. routes/index.js
5. controllers/home.js - Fix the bug
6. public/index.pug
